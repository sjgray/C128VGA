Simple C128 to VGA 15kHz Adapter
================================

This is an adapter to convert the C128's 80-column RGBI output
to any VGA monitor that accepts 15kHz scan rate. It uses a
simple RGBI to RGB DAC and does not require any external power.
The adapter also has an RCA connector for Mono composite out.

Notes
-----

The DB9 and DE15 pcb-mount connectors both need the hex screws removed in order to connect.
Some cheap connectors will fall apart if the screws are removed. Find ones that are crimped properly.
